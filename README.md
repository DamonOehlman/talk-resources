# HTML5 Presentation Helpers

This is a collection of CSS, Javascript and supporting resources that are designed to supplement some of the excellent HTML5 presentation resources currently available.

If you are interested in integrating these into your presentations, then I'd highly recommend checking out [BoxIt](https://github.com/DamonOehlman/boxit) which is a tool to assist with creating slide decks using HTML5 tech for a variety of HTML5 presentation engines.
